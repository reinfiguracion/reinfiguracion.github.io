                  <p>The Microsoft Word (.doc) format opens on PCs with Windows and either Microsoft Word or WordPad. On Mac, you will need Microsoft Word for Mac, Pages or AppleWorks to open this type of file. Text Edit on Mac OS X can also open these files.
                    The benefit of using Microsoft Word files is that you may edit the form on your computer.</p>
                  <p>The Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format works on both PCs and Macs. You need the Acrobat Reader software to view these files (or the Preview Application included in Mac OS X). The benefit of Acrobat (.pdf) files is that they look and print identically
                    on all computers. However, our Acrobat files are not editable. You may only print them.</p>
                  <p>If you have any questions about the documents please don’t hesitate to contact us.</p>
