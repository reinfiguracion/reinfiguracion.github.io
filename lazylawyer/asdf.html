          <strong>Why spend time writing complicated legal documents when you can simply use templates like the ones the lawyers use themselves?</strong>
        </h2>
        "The Lazy Law" website started by a law graduate, passionate about helping people, gives you access to documents and templates like the ones lawyers use on a daily basis without having to fork out the exorbitant legal fees. In just one click the legal
        document of choice is at your fingertips.
        <h4>The Secret? "Productive Laziness"</h4>
        Productive laziness is all about success, but success with far less effort. As a law graduate, running her own business Kate understands juggling the pressures in life. "Adopt a balanced approach. Focus your energies on those things which will add the
        greatest value to whatever you’re trying to achieve so that it leaves you with more time to do the things you enjoy." Let me challenge your thinking for just one moment. Would you believe me if I was to tell you that lazy does not mean unsuccessful
        or stupid? Being productively lazy allows you to still achieve those higher goals but on your own terms. Ever heard of the 80/20 Rule? It states that 80% of the results stem from 20% of the causes. This rule applies to various aspects of life
        and equally so at large law firms. 80% of the revenue from billables is directly generated from only 20% of the client base. These clients are playing in the big league, they’re the corporations and business tycoons with hefty retainers. Obviously
        in the firm’s eyes its smart business practice to look after them. So when an individual comes along, with a legal issue, substantial to that person, the firm views them as small fry and relatively insignificant. Harsh but true. Despite the fact
        the legal problem you face has the potential to significantly impact your life, the lawyer is unlikely to focus all his efforts on you. Of course you’ll be charged handsomely for the service, which you may or may not ultimately be happy with.
        So my question to you is this. If you could access exactly the documents you needed without paying legal fees would you not consider it? Of course you could attempt to compose the document or binding legal agreement yourself, but why not be smart
        and use The Lazy Law templates? After all with just one click you get the documents you need.
        <div class="takeaway">
          Remember being lazy isn’t what you think it to be. Smart Lazy people have an edge over all others.
