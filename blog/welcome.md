# Prose.io content editor for Github #

Browser-based content editors will emerge that make Jekyll feel like WordPress and the world will be crazy ready.

## Static Site Generators ##

Currently static-site generators are the domain of techno-dweebs who aren't afraid of putzing around on the command line to publish a blog post. Once these types get familiar with Jekyll, Middleman, or Hugo (which is go-based, i.e. incredibly fast to compile) they are lifetime converts. With good reason, these tools make it incredibly easy to create and host a maintainable, secure, blog-oriented site with completely badass performance. The site is just static files after all.
